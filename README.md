# myERP API


The myERP API gem allows Ruby developers to programmatically access the data of myERP accounts.

The API is implemented as JSON over HTTP using all four verbs (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE). Each resource, like Account, Item, or Order, has its own URL and is manipulated in isolation. In other words, weâ€™ve tried to make the API follow the REST principles as much as possible.

For more information and detailed documentation about the API visit http://developers.myerp.com

## Installation

To easily install or upgrade to the latest release, use [gem](http://rubygems.org/)

    gem install myerp_api

## Getting Started

The myERP API uses ActiveResource to communicate with the REST web service.

- 1 - Retrieve your API_KEY and your API_EMAIL from the API settings. More information [here](http://developers.myerp.com/docs/1.0/overview/security_authentication.html).

- 2 - Initiate the client by:

```ruby
client = MyERP.client('API_EMAIL', 'API_KEY')
```
- 3 - Now you're ready to make authorized API requests to your domain! Data is returned as hashes:

```ruby
# Retrieve all customers and leads
puts client.customers.all

# Get a specific customer/lead
puts client.customers.find(261367)

# Create a customer
customer = MyERP::Customer.new
customer.type = 2 #individual
customer.status = 1 #customer
customer.first_name = "John"
customer.last_name = "Doe"
customer.email = "john.doe@mail.com"

customer = client.customers.save(customer)
puts "#{customer.full_name} created [id=#{customer.id}]"

# Update some fields
customer.first_name = "Jane"
customer = client.customers.save(customer)
puts "#{customer.full_name} updated [id=#{customer.id}]"

# Delete a customer
customer = client.customers.delete(customer)
puts "#{customer.full_name} deleted [id=#{customer.id}]"

# Bulk creation/modification
customers = client.customers.bulkSave([customer, customer2])
puts customers

# Bulk deletion
customers = client.customers.delete([customer, customer2])
puts customers
```
